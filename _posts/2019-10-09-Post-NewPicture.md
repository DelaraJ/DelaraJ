*A brief description of Sophia*

-Hanson Robotics’ most advanced human-like robot, Sophia, personifies our dreams for the future of AI. As a unique combination of science, engineering, and artistry, Sophia is simultaneously a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics, and a platform for advanced robotics and AI research.  

-Sophia was first activated on February 14, 2016.The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti,Audrey Hepburn, and its inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,is known for its human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. As of 2018, Sophia's architecture includes scripting software, a chat system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning.

-Sophia imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).Sophia uses speech recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (the parent company of Google) and is "designed to get smarter over time".[citation needed] Its speech synthesis ability is provided by CereProc's text-to-speech engine, and also allows it to sing. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics.The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.

-The character of Sophia captures the imagination of global audiences. She is the world’s first robot citizen and the first robot Innovation Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. Sophia is now a household name, with appearances on the Tonight Show and Good Morning Britain, in addition to speaking at hundreds of conferences around the world.

-Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts. Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as 60 Minutes's Charlie Rose.In a piece for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies".Musk tweeted that Sophia should watch The Godfather and asked "what's the worst that could happen?"Business Insider's chief UK editor Jim Edwards interviewed Sophia, and while the answers were "not altogether terrible", he predicted that Sophia was a step towards "conversational artificial intelligence".
